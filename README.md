# vim-autoparen-toy

This plugin is improvised and not serious. For practical purposes, refer to [this version](https://github.com/Ace-Who/vim-autoparen).

This plugin defines a mapping for the `(` key.

After typing an open parenthesis, the user will be asked for the next character.
Unless that itself is a closed parenthesis, a closed parenthesis will be
automatically appended.
